# lmn

[ijk](https://github.com/lukejacksonn/ijk) is the best way to write HTML/VDOM! (_-But I..._ - _Sssshhh, sshsshh, yes it is. Trust me, OK?_)

But we also love to copy and paste HTML snippets from our favorite CSS Frameworks. That's why lmn exists. Try it out: https://slacktracer.github.io/lmn/.

**lmn** will make creating your [Hyperapp](https://github.com/hyperapp/hyperapp) apps a bit easier. Hopefully. It does it for me. =)

I'll get back with more information if ever necessary. Thank you for reading! \o/
